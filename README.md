# PumpGrok

![PumpGrok banner](banner.jpg)

PumpGrok is an eight-role Solana memecoin trading desk packaged as agent instructions, 24 skills, a hard security constitution, and read-only Python helpers. It is loaded into a host agent runtime (Grok Bot, Cursor, Claude Code, or Grok Build). Agents are not signers: they emit structured trade-candidate JSON only. A separate `execution/` package can sign locally and is disabled by default (`TRADING_MODE=paper`). Private keys never enter agents, prompts, skills, SQLite, or git.

Version 1.0.0.

## Capabilities

- Eight specialist roles: CHIEF, SCOUT, RISK, WHALE, SNIPER, RUG, EXIT, SHILL (`agents/`)
- 24 skills covering desk constitution, ticket lifecycle, risk audit, Jupiter routing, discovery, journal conventions, the paper research loop (`skills/research-paper-layer`), and a vendored dry-run screening engine (`skills/grokbot-pipeline`)
- SQLite research store and deterministic paper engine (`python -m layer`, also `npm run research|scan|paper|status`)
- Disabled local execution package (`execution/`, `npm run live` refuses by default)
- Always-on desk rule `rules/pumpgrok-team.mdc` (RISK veto, human approval by ticket ID, single-send, no private keys)
- Read-only CLI helpers for Jupiter quotes, mint/freeze authority, priority fees, ticket IDs, paper fills, holder concentration, and pipeline JSONL evidence (`tools/pipeline_evidence.py`)
- Repo linter `scripts/check.sh` (frontmatter, constitution phrases, one-writer convention; no network)
- Plugin manifests for Grok Bot (`plugin.json`), Claude Code (`.claude-plugin/`), Cursor (`.cursor-plugin/`), and Grok Build (`.grok-plugin/`)

The desk starts in **research** mode. **paper** logs simulated fills via `tools/paper_sim.py` and `python -m layer paper`. **micro-live** is only enabled after the risk-limits interview and explicit user confirmation. This fork does not enable live trading. Hypotheses under `research/strategies/` are not proof and are not return claims.

## Requirements

- A host that can load `agents/`, `skills/`, and `rules/` (Grok Bot, Cursor, Claude Code, or Grok Build)
- Python 3 (used by `scripts/check.sh` and `tools/`)
- `requests` for most tools (`pip install requests`)
- Optional: a private Solana RPC URL passed as `--rpc` (tools default to `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`)

No lockfile or version pin is in this repository. No API keys are required for the public endpoints the tools call.

## Setup and usage

Full Grok Bot bootstrap (clone, folders, skills, eight Bots, Trading Floor, desk record) is in [SETUP.md](SETUP.md). That flow is read-only: no keys, no real trades.

From this repository:

```bash
./scripts/check.sh
```

Exit 0 means the instruction tree looks healthy.

Optional tools:

```bash
pip install requests

python tools/jupiter_quote.py \
  --input-mint So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112 \
  --output-mint <TOKEN_MINT> \
  --amount 100000000 \
  --slippage-bps 100

python tools/authority_check.py --mint <TOKEN_MINT>
python tools/priority_fee.py --multiplier 1.2
python tools/ticket_helper.py next
python tools/holder_check.py --mint <TOKEN_MINT> --limit 20
python tools/paper_sim.py --action buy --ticket SOL-20260827-001 \
  --mint <TOKEN_MINT> --size-usd 25 --price 0.000012 --slippage-bps 80
```

Working files for a live desk belong under `/workspace/trading-desk/` (created by setup), not inside this repo. `tools/ticket_helper.py` falls back to `./trading-desk/proposals` when `/workspace` is absent.

Paper research from this fork:

```bash
python -m layer status
python -m layer scan --input path/to/candidates.json
python -m layer research --out research/daily/2026-09-26.json
npm test
npm run live   # refuses; does not trade
```

`research/strategies/` holds paper hypotheses, not proof. Hard caps stay at 0.005 SOL per buy, 0.03 SOL exposure, and a 0.02 SOL reserve.

Cursor / Claude Code / Grok Build load `skills/`, `agents/`, and `rules/` from the plugin manifests. On runtimes without persistent Bots, `rules/pumpgrok-team.mdc` says to use subagents or role-labelled passes.
