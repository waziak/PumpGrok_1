# Scripts

Validation and helper scripts for the PumpGrok repository.

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `check.sh` | Lints frontmatter, agent definitions, skill structure, security constitution presence, one-writer conventions, and the Hermes cron pack. No network required. |
| `security_audit.py` | Fails if populated key material is found. Prints `PRIVATE KEY EXPOSED: NO` when the tree is clean. |
| `hermes-bootstrap.sh` | Create eight isolated Hermes profiles (`HERMES_HOME` per role) and the shared `trading-desk` file bus. Does not clone default-profile memory or tokens. |
| `hermes-install-cron.sh` | Install scout/risk/chief/rug cron jobs. Refuses SNIPER/EXIT owners. |
| `hermes-verify-isolation.sh` | Check profile isolation, forbidden env keys, file-bus layout, and desk_state.py. |

## Usage

```bash
# From the repository root
./scripts/check.sh
./scripts/hermes-bootstrap.sh --desk "$HOME/trading-desk"
./scripts/hermes-install-cron.sh --desk "$HOME/trading-desk"
./scripts/hermes-verify-isolation.sh --desk "$HOME/trading-desk"
```

Exit code 0 = healthy.
Non-zero = problems listed on stdout.

## Design notes

- Pure stdlib Python (no external dependencies) for check/state helpers.
- Adapted from the HyperGrok `scripts/check.sh` pattern.
- Enforces:
  - Proper YAML frontmatter on agents and skills
  - Global Security Constitution phrases present in agent files
  - `rules/pumpgrok-team.mdc` exists
  - No emoji in instruction files
  - Soft checks on write-capable agents (SNIPER / EXIT)
  - Hermes cron prompts exist and sniper/exit are not cron owners
- `check.sh` excludes `vendor/` from the emoji sweep; `vendor/grokbot-pumpfun` has its own pytest.
- Hermes bootstrap never uses `--clone-all`.
- Cron state machine is research/paper only.
